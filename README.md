Hiking the New Hampshire 4000 Footers 
What am I making?

Create an interactive and informational website about the NH 4000 Footers. Hiking the 4000 footers in NH has become very popular. There are so many resources out on the web to get information on ratings, weather, suggested packing and safety precautions.

Why am I making this? 

I am making this because I have a passion for hiking and think it will be nice to have it out on the web or even share with the AMC (Appalachian Mountain Club). Currently there are several non user-friendly websites around with information sprinked everywhere. Most are not user friendly, not mobile friendly.

 

My audience

My intended audience is for hikers, with a focus on new hikers looking to get some basic foundational information and resources on the NH 48’s. 

 

Technologies 

HTML, CSS, CSS Animations, JS

 

What I hope to accomplish with this project (Extras) 

With time, I hope to include fun animations like clouds floating across banner and a fun animated 404 page using JS. Example, click on the about link and have 404 page related to ‘Gone Hiking’ 



Link to Prototype
